  ## Description
  The purpose of this project was to build a text editor using a package called idb, PWA, express, etc. It was so much fun creating something that is functional offline/an app that can be installed! Deploying to render was a little difficult at first but it helped me realize that my package json file was not in the root of my project, so I think I've got a good understanding of how to deploy to render now :D

  User Story <br>
  AS A developer<br>
  I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection<br>
  SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use

  Acceptance Criteria<br>
  GIVEN a text editor web application<br>
  WHEN I open my application in my editor<br>
  THEN I should see a client server folder structure<br>
  WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory<br>
  THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client<br>
  WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal<br>
  THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack<br>
  WHEN I run my webpack plugins<br>
  THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file<br>
  WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application<br>
  THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors<br>
  WHEN I open the text editor<br>
  THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage<br>
  WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window<br>
  THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB<br>
  WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it<br>
  THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB<br>
  WHEN I click on the Install button<br>
  THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop<br>
  WHEN I load my web application<br>
  THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox<br>
  WHEN I register a service worker<br>
  THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets<br>
  WHEN I deploy to Render<br>
  THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
